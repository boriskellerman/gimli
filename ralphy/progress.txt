# Progress: Create MCP Server Connections

## Task
Create MCP server connections if beneficial (TAC Grade 3: Custom Tools)

## Date
2026-02-01

## Summary
Evaluated MCP server connections for Gimli and determined that dedicated Gimli-specific
MCP servers are not immediately beneficial. The codebase already has comprehensive MCP
integration through existing mechanisms.

## Evaluation

### Existing MCP Infrastructure
1. **mcporter** - External MCP tool calling (used by `gimli docs` command)
2. **ACP (Agent Client Protocol)** - IDE integration exposing Gimli as MCP-compatible agent
3. **Claude Code Plugins** - 30+ MCP servers already enabled (GitHub, Playwright, etc.)

### Why Dedicated Gimli MCP Servers Are Not Needed Now
- Gateway health, channel status, and config access work via CLI (`gimli doctor`, etc.)
- Agents can call CLI commands through bash tool
- Session management already built into Pi agent tools
- No cross-process or cross-language requirements currently

### When MCP Would Be Beneficial (Future)
- Cross-process communication with non-Gimli agents
- Language-agnostic tooling (Python/Go callers)
- Remote access without shell
- Type-safe structured schemas

## Files Created

### docs/reference/MCP_INTEGRATION.md
- Documents current MCP capabilities
- Evaluation of Gimli-specific MCP needs
- Guidance for adding MCP servers when beneficial
- References to existing MCP infrastructure

### .mcp.json
- Minimal MCP configuration file
- Documents the existing docs.gimli.bot MCP endpoint
- Serves as template for future expansion

## Recommendation
No code changes needed at this time. The task explicitly says "if beneficial" and the
evaluation shows existing infrastructure is sufficient. Documentation was added to
guide future MCP integration when/if needs arise.
