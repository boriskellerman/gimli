  "transcript": "The prompt is now\nthe fundamental unit of\nengineering. And with agents,\nevery prompt you create\nbecomes a force multiplier.\nOne well-crafted prompt can\ngenerate tens and hundreds\nof hours of productive\nwork. One bad prompt\ncompounds failure at the\nsame rate. So how\ndo you consistently create\nprompts that deliver two,\nfive, 10, 100X returns\non your time investment?\nThe answer starts with\na senior engineering mindset\nshift. You have to\nask yourself, who am\nI creating these prompts\nfor? It's not just\nfor you. It's not\njust for your team.\nWe're now engineering for\nthree audiences, you, your\nteam, your agents. This\nis the stakeholder trifecta\nfor the age of\nagents. This is the\nagentic shift that most\nengineers haven't yet made.\nThe winners here are\nbuilding libraries of reusable\nbattle-tested agentic prompts with\ncomposable sections that work\nlike lego blocks. You\ncan swap these in\nand swap them out\nwhen and if you\nneed them to scale\nyour engineering impact with\ncompute. You saw this\nhands-on inside of TAC.\nEvery prompt we built\nhad a similar structure,\nsome with certain sections,\nsome without them. By\nwriting these prompts consistently,\nwe were able to\ncommunicate with ourselves, with\nour future self, our\nteam, and of course,\nour agents. Most importantly,\nyour agents. And once\nyou write these prompts,\nonce they become reusable,\nyou get to a\nlevel where you know\nwhat the prompt will\ndo given a certain\ninput. And this accelerates\nyou along the path\nof moving from inside\nthe loop, outside the\nloop, all the way\nup to ZTE, a\ncritical concept we discuss\nin TAC. This is\nthe North Star of\nagentic coding. You want\nto be handing off\nmore work to compute\nand setting up systems\nthat trigger your workflow\nso your presence isn't\nneeded. You want to\nbe building AFK agents.\nAnd this all comes\nback to the skill\nthat was once mocked\nas a joke, prompt\nengineering. But things have\nchanged. We're now agentic\nprompt engineering. And every\nprompt you write, every\nline that goes into\nyour prompt has the\nability to call Tens\nand hundreds of tool\ncalls and run from\nminutes to hours. This\nmakes a gigantic prompt\nengineering one of the\nmost important skills for\nengineers to focus and\nmaster. And of course,\nthat's what we're talking\nabout today, right here,\nright now. We're going\nto understand the seven\nmost powerful agentic prompt\nformats and most importantly,\nthe exact sections that\nmake them up. We're\ntalking about the most\nuseful sections for your\nprompts and how challenging\nthey are to operate,\nhow much skill you\nneed to operate, not\njust the prompts themselves,\nbut the individual sections,\ntitle, metadata, workflow, relevant\nfiles, codebase structure.\nAnd we have our\nlist of prompts that\nwe're going to work\nthrough. The prompt is\neverything. Context engineering is\nincredibly important, but we\ncan't forget about the\nunderlying skill that dictates\neverything, the prompt, and\nnow the agentic prompt.\nWhat we're doing here\nis learning how to\nbest communicate what we\nwant to the trifecta,\nyou, your team, and\nyour agents. Let's level\nup our agentic prompt\nengineering abilities by mastering\nthe prompts and their\ncomposable sections. So at\nthe first level, we\nhave the high level\nprompt. It's the reusable\nad hoc static prompt.\nThis is the one\noff that you throw\ninto a file as\nsoon as you start\nrepeating work that you\nknow that your agent\ncan do without a\nproblem. It contains up\nto three and no\nless than one section.\nTitle. high level prompt\nand purpose. We have\nprompt examples here we're\ngonna work through as\nwe progress through each\nlevel of our agentic\nprompt formats. Let's start\nwith all tools. So\ninside the agentic prompt\nengineering codebase, we\nhave the simple list\nall tools prompt and\nit does exactly what\nyou think it does.\nWe're asking our agent\nto look at their\nsystem prompt and list\nall of their tools.\nThis has just two\nsections, title and the\nhigh level prompt. And\nwe can of course\nkick open a new\nClaude Code instance run\nall tab and kick\nthis off. There's a\ntypical classic prompt. It\nhelps you understand what\nyour agent can see.\nBy the way, you\ncan run this in\nany chat interface, any\nagent to understand what\nthey can do. We\nhave a title and\na high level prompt.\nThese prompts are going\nto stack up on\neach other, but let's\ngo ahead and just\nplace our first two\nsections. We have the\ntitle. How useful is\nthis and how much\nskill do you need\nto operate the title\nsection of your agentic\nprompts? Not much and\nnot very, right? So,\nI'm gonna throw the\ntitle down here in\nthe C tier for\nusefulness and D tier\nfor skill requirement. We\nalso have the high\nlevel prompt. Now this\nis gonna be more\nuseful and very easy\nto write. There's not\nmuch going on here,\nright? Just type a\nhigh level void of\ndetail description of what\nyou want your agent\nto do and hope\nthat they do it.\nSo let's scale this\nup a little bit\nmore with the start\nprompt. So again, we\nhave a very similar\nstructure, but here you\ncan see we have\na little bit more\ndetail. So we have\nour title, we have\nthe purpose, and then\nwe have our high\nlevel prompt that's starting\nto move into mid-level\nterritory, right? We have\nsome details here. We\nhave the CD command.\nWe have bun install,\nbun dev. So there's\nmore detail here, but\nthis is still a\nsimple, high level prompt\nwith the one addition\nof the purpose. We\nhave one line where\nwe're saying, hey, this\nis exactly what you're\nmeant to do. Notice\nthe tone of voice\nhere. We're speaking to\nour agent, right? Start\nthe agentic prompt tier\nlist application for development.\nThis is the purpose\nof this agent when\nwe run this. Okay.\nAnd so purpose is\npowerful and it's simple\nto use. This is\ngoing to be B\ntier useful and it's\ngoing to be D\ntier skill requirement right\nit's quite simple to\nwrite a purpose just\nsay what you're trying\nto do as you\ncan see here the\nhigh level prompt is\nvery simple this is\na great place to\nstart it's a terrible\nplace to end whenever\nyou start doing repeat\nwork hand it off\nto your agent right\nthree times marks a\npattern copy whatever you're\ndoing and just write\nit as a high\nlevel prompt and then\nmove up the levels\nfrom there all right\nso in terms of\nusefulness and difficulty We're\ngonna go ahead and\ngrade the high level\nprompt in the exact\nsame tier list here.\nSo you can get\ndecent value out of\nthe high level prompt\nwithout putting in much\neffort, right? This doesn't\nrequire any skill. Just\ntype and ask for\nwhat you want. Now,\nthe next prompt format\nwe're gonna look at\nis exponentially more powerful.\nLet me show you\nexactly why. Now we\nreach level two and\nlevel two is a\nhuge milestone. The next\nprompt we're gonna look\nat is the workflow\nprompt. This prompt represents\na sequential workflow with\na bunch of new\nadditional sections that you\ncan work with. Out\nof all the agentic\nprompt formats we'll look\nat, this is easily\nthe most important one.\nWhy is that? It's\nbecause of this workflow\nsection. Let's go ahead\nand grade the workflow\nsection and the workflow\nprompt just to set\nthe stage to showcase\nhow powerful and how\nuseful this is. So\nworkflow and throw it\ninto the S usefulness.\nThis is the most\nuseful section and we're\ngoing to throw it\nin C tier difficulty.\nIt's actually not that\nchallenging. to use the\nworkflow as you'll see\nin a second. We're\nalso gonna take the\nworkflow prompt and place\nit in A tier\nusefulness and C tier\nskill requirement. So these\nare both very useful,\nvery powerful. And so\nwhy is this so\npowerful? Let's look at\none of the most\nbasic versions of this\nin the prime command.\nSo this is something\nyou've likely seen me\nuse. The prime command\nsets up your agent\nto gain an understanding\nof the codebase\nso it can start\nworking. As you can\nsee here, you can\nbuild many prime commands\nto do and operate\non different sections of\nyour codebase. We\ndig deeper into why\nyou should use a\nprime command over classic\nmemory files and our\nelite context engineering lesson.\nCheck that out if\nyou haven't. But here\nwe have several sections\nto break down. So\ninformation in the report,\nit all goes under\nthe report section, right?\nThis is your output\nsection. This is your\nformat section, okay? And\nto be super clear,\nyou can call these\nsections whatever you want.\nI'm using the most\nconsistent, the most information\ndense keywords to represent\nevery section, okay? Out\nof the tens of\nthousands of prompts I've\nseen and used and\nrun these sections, keep\ncoming back over and\nover and over. So\nno matter what you\ncall them, they're still\ngoing to be there\nas you scale up\nthe level and the\ncapability of your agentic\nprompts. You can see\nhere, this is the\nfoundation for the workflow\nprompt. All right, we're\nnow executing a series\nof steps that can\nget very complex that\ncan call many, many\ntools. All right, so\nlet's look at another\nprompt, right? We have\nthis build prompt. Let's\ncheck this out. And\nyou can see here\na little bit more\nmetadata, right? Our build\nprompt is only able\nto use read, write\nand bash tools. And\nit has an argument\nhint. The argument of\ncourse leads to a\nreally important section, a\nsuper underappreciated section, the\nvariables. Okay. And so,\nyou know, before we\nget to variables, everything\nelse is the same.\nright? We have the\ntitle, we have the\npurpose. In our purpose\nhere, we're being a\nbit more prescriptive about\nwhat to do exactly.\nAnd then we have\nour workflow and our\nreport section. Variables is\nvery, very important, right?\nThis is where your\nprompts become massively more\nvaluable. A lot of\nthe work we do\nis repeat work that\nruns in step sequences\nof steps, right? This\nis what the agentic\nworkflows right now are\nsolving for us. And\nyou can throw agentic\nworkflows right into one\nof these workflow prompts,\nright? You can also\nscale them up with\nADWs as you've seen\nand as we've discussed\nat length and tack,\nbut the variable section\nis ultra important because\nnow we're parsing the\nclaw code arguments syntax\nhere and in our\nprompt, when this gets\nexecuted, this is going\nto update so that\nwhatever the value is\nhere, right? Right. So\npath to plan and\nthen check this out.\nWe are referencing the\nname of our variable\nthroughout our prompt, okay?\nVariables let you pass\ninformation into your prompts.\nHere we're building up\nour own easy to\nunderstand natural language variable\nsyntax that we can\nreference throughout the prompt,\nokay? And powerful modern\nlanguage models running in\nthese agents. They're powerful\nenough to know exactly\nwhat you mean when\nyou keep referencing it,\nespecially in this syntax,\nright? This consistent syntax.\nNot only is this\ngreat for your agent,\nit is of course\ngreat for you and\nyour team. Look at\nhow easy this is\nto understand, right? We\nhave a variable coming\nin and this is\nthe path to the\nplan, okay? So very\npowerful stuff here. This\nis a dynamic variable\nin contrast to a\nstatic variable. Let's go\nahead and grade this,\nright? How powerful are\nvariables? How useful are\nthey? These of course\nare very useful this\nis gonna be a\ntier usefulness and we're\ngonna put this in\nB tier difficulty right\nB tier skill requirement\nbecause now we're referencing\nvariables both static and\ndynamic across your prompt\nokay and you can\nsee here this is\njust a simple 23\nline prompt this is\ngonna scale up in\ndifficulty right let's go\nahead and look at\na bigger prompt Let's\nlook at quick plan.\nSo when I'm working\nwith prompts, I like\nto just always open\nit up in full\nand then collapse to\nthe second level so\nthat you can see\nall of the sections\nconsistently. You can quickly\nsee the composable sections\nin this prompt. OK,\nthis immediately gives you\na good idea of\nhow complex and how\npowerful the prompt is.\nSo you can see\nhere we have more\nmetadata. We have the\nmodel now argument, hint,\ndescription and allowed tools\ntitle. And then we\nhave our purpose. And\nso notice the language\nhere, right? Create a\ndetailed implementation plan based\non the users requirements.\nWe're just like very\ndirectly talking to our\nagent. All right. And\nso by contrast, by\nhaving this very kind\nof dry, direct language,\nyou and any engineer\non your team can\ncome to this prompt\nand collapse everything and\njust read this upper\nsection to understand exactly\nwhat this does, right?\nAnd what the capabilities\nare. Then you can\njust dial in one\npiece at a time,\nright? So what are\nthe variables here? You\ncan see here we\nhave that user prompt\ncoming in as the\nargument and we have\nthe plan output directory.\nNow this is different,\nright? You can see\nhow different this is.\nThis is a static\nvariable. This is a\nvariable we're placing right\nin the prompt that\ndoesn't change. You can't\npass anything in to\noverwrite this. This is\na powerful static variable\nversus a the user\nprompt. a dynamic variable,\nright? That changes as\nyou pass in work.\nThis prompt is going\nto write to the\nspecs directory, right? And\nif you want to,\nyou can change this\nto be anything you\nwant. So say you\nlike PRDs, right? This\nwill write to the\nPRD directory, right? All\nyou have to do\nis update this, save\nit, and that's it,\nright? You don't have\nto keep referencing this\neverywhere. And of course,\nWe can copy this\nand do a search\nsections, you know exactly\nwhat this is gonna\ndo. We do have\na new instruction section\nhere. Let's think through\nthis, right? How is\nthis different than the\nworkflow section in your\nagentic prompts? So the\nworkflow is the step-by-step\nplay of exactly what\nyou want your agent\nto do. Oftentimes, your\nagent if it's a\nClaude Code level agent,\nit's gonna come through\nand create a list,\na concrete list inside\nof its to-dos, inside\nof its plan of\nyour workflow. So this\nmaps very, very well\nto modern agentic coding\ntools. As specified below,\nyou can see here\nwe're creating a specific\noutput type. We're almost\nbleeding into the examples\nsection, but this is\njust a report, okay?\nSo we're just specifying\nthe output format we\nwant. So the workflow\nis a play-by-play step\nof what we want\ndone. And then the\ninstructions are surrounding information\non the individual steps\nin the workflow. So\nthis is a great\nplace to just come\nin and add auxiliary\ninformation on how your\nworkflow should work. Now,\nto be clear, oftentimes\nyou can just combine\nthese. Right, and you\ncan create nested bullet\npoints underneath your workflow\nsteps. In upcoming prompts,\nyou're gonna see that\nexactly. But you can\nuse instructions to just\nquickly tag on useful\ninformation to aid your\nworkflow, okay? So we\nhave one new additional\nsection here, right? We\nhave the instructions section.\nSo how does this\nrank? This is gonna\nbe right below the\nreport. Right, so probably\nas useful and as\nchallenging to use is\nthe report section, right?\nThis is a bullet\nlist of additional information\nthat aids the workflow,\nokay? So it's not\nultra difficult to use,\nbut oftentimes you don't\nneed the instructions. You\ncan just use a\nworkflow. All right, but\nI wanted to call\nthis out. These are\ntwo distinct patterns. And\nespecially when we start\ntalking about system prompts\nversus user prompts, you're\ngoing to see that\nthe instructions are going\nto be a lot\nmore valuable for your\nsystem prompt versus your\nworkflow. When you're writing\nthese reusable agentic prompts,\nthis of course is\ngoing to be a\nlot more useful for\nthe actual play by\nplay that you want\nyour agent to run\nin a repeat fashion.\nWe have the prime\ntier list. Okay. And\nI just want to\nshow this off. We\nhave one additional section\nhere and we have\nno metadata. So notice\nthis format, right? Title\npurpose. And then we\nhave code-based structure This\nis a distinct section.\nWe have our workflow\nand you can see\nour workflow is getting\na little bit more\ncomplex here. We'll break\nthat down in a\nsecond. And we have\nour report. Okay, so\njust a kind of\nsuper simple blank report.\nLet's go ahead and\ntalk about the code\nbase structure. What is\nthis new section? Another\nway to think about\nthe codebase structure\nsection that you can\nswap in and out\nof your agentic prompts.\nThis is really a\ncontext map, right? This\nis the real name\nof the codebase\nstructure. But normally this\nis just, you know,\nas we're engineers working\nin codebases, This\nis usually just called\ncodebase structure, okay?\nAnd the distinction here\nis that you're not\nsaying, right, you're not\ntelling your agent to\nread these files. You're\ngiving them a quick\nmap of where the\nfiles are, what the\nstructure looks like of\nthe relevant code, right?\nWe have a prime\ntier list here. So\nwe're priming against a\nspecific part of our\napplication and we're specifying\nexactly what every file\ndoes, you know, at\na hundred foot view.\nThere's our previous prime\ncommand that ran. We\ncan of course clear\nthat out and then\nprime the tier list\nand now the tier\nlist is going to\nrun not these files,\nbut in our workflow,\nwe've specified exactly what\nfiles we want to\nread. Okay, read these\nfiles exclusively. We have\nto be a little\nbit stronger with our\nlanguage here. We have\nan information dense keyword\nimportant that has more\nvalue to our agents\nand to the models\nthat run them. And\nso you can see\nhere, we're only reading\nthese specific files, but\nour agent now has\nin its context window,\nthanks to our prompt\nengineering, it has a\nmap of how to\nquickly find relevant files.\nOkay, so instead of\nhaving to search this\nmanually, run additional tools,\nchew up additional tokens,\nit has a quick\nsimple map. Okay. And\nagain, codebase structure,\nyou and your team\ncan quickly look at\nthis and understand it.\nLet's go ahead and\nrank this one. This\nis not as useful\nbecause of course agents\ncan do this. The\nbig benefit here is\nthat it's faster, right?\nThis speeds your agent\nup. It helps your\nagent understand more quickly.\nSo we're going to\nthrow this right under\nmetadata, right? Code base\nstructure is about C\ntier usefulness and it's\nnot that challenging to\nuse. We're just giving\na codebase structure.\nand we're asking for\na little bit of\ndetail, all right? But\nnow the important interesting\nthing here is our\nworkflow. If we look\nat our workflow via\nregex, we have a\nmore built out list.\nAnd so your workflow\ncan be as detailed\nas you need it\nto be. So as\nwe cycle through this,\nYou know, you can\nsee here we still\nhave our numbered list,\nbut underneath this we're\nadding additional details, right?\nWe even have a\nlist with a list\nunderneath. Okay. And so\nuse we can get\nout of our prompts\nby using these consistent\nand swappable prompt structures.\nThe workflow prompt is\nvery, very powerful. All\nthe prompts stack up\non each other and\nthe workflow prompt is\nan absolute pillar for\nall subsequent prompt levels.\nIt's important to note\nhere, by the way,\nthat every one of\nthese prompts, if you\nopen up build, every\none of these prompts\nhas a kind of\nconsistent structure, right? It\nhas the inputs, it\nhas the workflow and\nit has the output,\ninput, workflow, output. This\nis a very consistent\nthree-step pattern you can\nuse to think about\nhow to design and\nbuild your prompts, right?\nInputs, we have the\nactual work that your\nagent does, and then\nwe have the report.\nNow, obviously, all of\nthis information is important\nfor your agent, but\nthe input and the\noutput are specifically useful\nfor you and your\nteam. Now we can\nquickly know what's coming\nin and what's going\nout, right? Of course,\nwe'll be spending a\nlot of time on\nthe workflow, dialing this\nin, making it do\nexactly what you want,\nbut this is a\nuseful framework for thinking\nabout how to build\ngreat reusable agentic prompts\nconsistently, input, workflow, output.\nLet's move on to\nlevel three of our\nagentic prompt format. At\nthe next level, we\ncontinue building off our\nexisting sections. Let's open\nup build.md. You know,\nthis prompt is going\nto come up over\nand over. It's a\nvery powerful, very simple\nprompt, but you can\nsee there's something going\non here on line\n17. We have flow\ncontrol, okay? So level\nthree is the control\nflow So we're building\nup on our workflow\nsection and we're adding\nthis new capability. Remember,\nevery prompt is about\nthe capability that it\noffers you. Every prompt\nformat is about the\ncapability that it offers\nyou and your agent.\nThe control flow prompt\nlets us run conditions,\nloops, and early returns.\nYou can see here\nif no path to\nplan is provided, immediately\nstop and ask the\nuser to provide it.\nSo we can, of\ncourse, very quickly test\nthis. You can see\nhere our prime tier\nlist finished. It's got\na great, great detailed\nlayout for us on\nthis specific feature. Check\nout our extended lesson\non context engineering to\nunderstand how context priming\ncan be more valuable\nthan using a memory\nfile. But anyway, let's\ngo ahead and clear\nthis out. Right. And\nlet's just kick off\nbuild. And we pass\nin no path to\nour plan. Right. Our\nvariable isn't there. So\nright away, our agent\nsees this and it\nstops. Right. This is\nthe equivalent of an\nearly return asking for\nfeedback, right? We need\nsome information, we cannot\nproceed unless we have\na path to plan.\nThis is of course\nthe most simple version\nof flow control inside\nof your prompts. You\ncan imagine this getting\na lot more complex.\nThe most popular extension\nof this will be\nof course conditionals and\nloops. Let's open up\nthe create image prompt\nhere. We're creating an\nimage. We're going to\nrun that exact same\nunderstanding workflow, right? We\ncollapse everything on level\ntwo and we just\nanalyze the prompt top\nto bottom, right? We\nhave the metadata section.\nWe have the title.\nWe have a kind\nof a bad tone\nof voice purpose, but\nit's fine. This will\nget through. We're saying\nthis command generates images.\nReally you want that\ndirect tone of voice.\nYou'd say something like\nthis, generate images based\non the provided prompt\nusing replicate MCP server.\nWe're talking to our\nagent. We have a\nrequest targeted toward our\nagent. All right, you\ncan see here two\nvariables. Let's open up\nour variables and you\ncan see here we're\nusing a new syntax.\nAnd we also have\na bunch of static\nvariables with a couple\nof bullet points. Okay,\nso let's analyze this,\nright? So we have\nword plus colon, and\nthis gives us our\nvariable format. So what's\ngoing on here, right?\nWe have several variables\nand we're using Cloud\nCode's positional argument for\nour first arg and\nthen our second argument.\nRight. So of course\nthis would look like\nthis slash create image.\nAnd you can see\nhere we would pass\nin something like some\nfile with image prompts\nand then we pass\nin a number positional\narguments. You know exactly\nhow that works. We\nhave three additional static\nvariables. Okay. So very\npowerful stuff here. We're\nstarting to use more\nstatic variables that we\ncan reference throughout our\nprompt. Right. This is\nvery useful for agents\nand to communicate value\nto yourself right in\nthe future and to\nyour team, right? So\nimage output directory, we\ncan quickly just see\nwhere this is referenced\nand we can see,\nyou know, the model\nwe're using, we can\nquickly just update the\nmodel that we're using\nto generate the image.\nAnd of course we\ncan update the aspect\nratio, so on and\nso forth, right? All\nthis stuff. We can\nadd arbitrary static and\ndynamic variables here, right?\nBut the interesting thing\nhere is in the\nworkflow, in these control\nflow prompts, you can\nof course, with natural\nlanguage, request loops. Okay,\nso we're saying important,\nthen generate number of\nimages, right? We're referencing\na variable using the\nimage generation prompt following\nmore complex, right? We're\ndoing more and more\nwith our prompts. Of\ncourse, have the report\ngenerates images at scale\nfor us in a\nloop. Let's go ahead\nand rank this. When\nit comes down to\nit, you know, the\nconditional flow prompt I\nwould say is about\nas powerful, probably a\nlittle bit more powerful,\nmore useful than the\nworkflow prompt, right? There's\nprobably a little bit\nabove this. It is\ngonna be more challenging\nthough. It requires more\nskill to think through\nand analyze the workflow\nstep in your prompt\nto understand the control\nflow that your prompt\nis working through, all\nright? So for that\nreason, we're gonna place\nthis in A tier\nusefulness and B tier\nskill requirement. Let's crack\nopen the edit image\nand you can see\na very similar format,\nyou know, nothing to\nchange here, right? We\nhave a consistent process,\nright? We have meditate\nat the top title,\npurpose, variables, workflow, and\nnotice here, no report\nsection. Remember every one\nof these sections is\nswappable. Use them only\nif you need it.\nIf you don't care\nabout the output format\nof your prompt, right?\nRemember the three-step workflow,\ninput, workflow, output. If\nyou don't care about\nyour output or if\nyou don't need variables\ncoming in, don't add\nthe section. Okay, this\nis the key to\nwriting great prompts. Only\nadd what you need,\nright? These are composable\npieces of your agentic\nprompts. Okay, so the\nedit image has no\noutput format. And so\nyou can see a\nsame deal here. If\nwe open everything up,\nwe have variables and\nwe have a workflow\nand our workflow has\na loop embedded inside\nof it. All right,\nand we also have\na stop command here,\nright? A couple conditionals,\nyou know, if the\ntoken is not available,\nexit immediately. If the\nbase64 command isn't available,\nexit immediately, right? This\nprompt does a specific\nthing in a specific\nworkflow very well with\na loop embedded. All\nright, that's the control\nflow prompt. Now we\ncontinue to scale up\nwhat we can do\nwith our agents while\nproperly communicating to the\ntrifecta. Let's go to\nlevel four. So at\nlevel four, we have\nthe delegation prompt, right?\nThe delegate prompt. This\nis a prompt that\nkicks off other agents\nto do work. Notice\nhow distinct every one\nof these prompts are.\nThey give you a\nnew advantage, right? A\nnew capability. Key section\nhere, if you're gonna\nbe delegating, you're going\nto want variables that\nyou can pass into\nyour sub-agents, okay? So\nthat's the only section\ntweak that you might\nmake. Let's go ahead\nand open up parallel\nsub-agents. Once again, you\nknow, same process, collapse.\nCheck out the format.\nThere's our metadata. title\npurpose. You know this\nworkflow should feel repetitive\nand that's what you\nwant right. You don't\nwant it to be\nnovel every time you\nopen up a prompt\nthat consumes your engineering\ncycles that consumes your\nability to work through\nmore engineering work and\nto generate value where\nyou want to be\nthinking less about the\nstuff that can be\nsolved with consistency. Consistency\nis the greatest weapon\nagainst confusion for both\nyou and your agent.\nThis is a key\nidea in both our\nextended elite context engineering\nlesson and in this\nlesson. We're clearly communicating.\nWe want to reduce\nconfusion to the very\nminimum. You want to\nbe thinking as you're\nwriting these prompts, you\nwant to be thinking,\nif I handed this\nto a coworker, could\nthey complete this work\ntop to bottom? If\nthat's true, you've probably\nwritten a high quality\nprompt. And imagine you\nhand them 10 additional\nprompts. don't change the\nprompt format every single\ntime. This is why\nthis consistency is so\nimportant. All right. So\nif you open up\nvariables here in our\nparallel sub agents, you\ncan see we have\ntwo positional dynamic variables,\nprompt request and count.\nRight. And you can\nquickly understand this prompt\nby reading the purpose,\nright. File workflow, launch\ncount in parallel to\naccomplish tasks detailed in\nprompt requests. All right.\nAnd then in the\nworkflow, step-by-step play nested\nbullet points nothing fancy\nvery consistent you can\nsee just referencing variables\nthroughout but so what\nis the key advantage\nof this type of\nagentic prompt format. We\nare handing off work\nto compute. We're having\nour agent fire off\nagents. So there are\nmany ways to use\nthis. If you've already\ntaken the elite context\nmanagement extended lesson, you\nalready know that there\nare only two ways\nto context engineer, R\nand D. And here\nwe're using the D\nof that framework, right?\nprompt and I'm gonna\ngo ahead and throw\nthis into S tier\nusefulness while being in\nA tier skill difficulty.\nOkay. This is an\nadvanced technique. Why is\nthat? It's because we're\nmanaging multiple instances of\nagents and we're writing\nprompts that write prompts,\nright? We are specifically\nsaying, right, we're talking\nto our primary agent.\nIn step two of\nour workflow, we're saying\ndesign agent prompts, create\ndetailed self-contained prompts for\neach agent. Include specific\ninstructions, define clear output\nexpectations, okay? We're really\nkind of building out\nthat input workflow output\nthree-step structure for our\nprimary agent to pass\ninto all of our\nsub-agents. This prompt is\nvery powerful. We're spinning\nup more compute that\nin itself can build\nout, you know, entire\nprompts and agents. So\nthis is a very\npowerful concept. This is\nthe future of engineering.\nOnce you build up\ngreat agents that perform\nfor you and get\nwork done, the next\nquestion is how many\nagents can you spin\nup? How much work\ncan you do? How\nmuch compute can you\nuse? Right? And of\ncourse, that's what TAC\nis all about. That\nwas a big, big\ntheme inside of TAC,\nspinning up these pipelines\nof agents that operate\nwith and without us\nvia Outloop systems, big\nidea, all this prompt\nengineering, all this agentic\nprompt engineering is just\nabout tapping into that\nbetter than anyone. So\nfor that reason, this\nis S tier, ultra\nuseful, ultra valuable, very\nhard to use though,\nright? You need to\nbe conscious about the\nflow of information between\nyour agents. So that's\njust one way to\nuse this, right? You\ncan see we're getting\nthat response flowing back\nin here. We can\nkick up another agent\nhere and let's go\nahead and run our\nload AI docs. Let's\ngo ahead and open\nthat up, load AI\ndocs. So once again,\nwith great agentic prompt\nengineering, we're just gonna\ncollapse everything, understand things\none step at a\ntime, right? Metadata, title,\npurpose, input, workflow, output,\nokay? Every single time,\nconsistency beats complexity, consistency\nmakes you faster. Okay,\nit makes your team\nfaster and it makes\nyour agents faster when\nyou find the working\nformula. And guess what?\nI'm handing you the\nworking formula right now\nwith these prompt formats.\nAll right, so you\ncan see here variables.\nWe just have one\nstatic variable for this\nload AI docs delegation\nprompt. We are going\nto delete old docs\nafter 24 hours and\nour AI docs here,\nwe have documentation for\nagents. And if we\nopen that up, Our\nagent has just deleted\nthem. It's just deleted\nall these and now\nit's going to reload\nthem because they were\nolder than 24 hours.\nYou can see here,\nsame deal. We're going\nto loop where we\nhave a explicit, a\nnew on the fly\ninformation dense keyword that\nwe can reference throughout\nour prompts. We have\na loop and we're\nactually having our agent\ncall a sub agent\ndirectly. And so you\ncan see this, we\nhave five doc scraper\nagents scraping the documentation\nand writing it to\na new file. We\nshould see some of\nthese come in here\nby now. Yep, there's\nour documentation coming in.\ninside of our AI\ndocs. All right. So\nour agents are bringing\nthose in one by\none. We are delegating.\nWe're offloading. Of course,\nonce again, this is\nthe D and the\nR and D framework\nof great elite context\nengineering. So this is\nultra powerful. And then\nwe have a simple\nbut specific report format.\nAnd you're going to\nsee our primary agent\nreturn in this exact\nreport format. Okay. We\nhave one more prompt\nhere, the background prompt.\nAnd you know, notice\nhow every previous level\nstacks up, right? You\ncan Pull in whatever\nlevels you need and\nto the highest level\nagain that you need\nto solve the problem.\nHere we're delegating agents.\nWe're using control flow.\nWe have conditional statements.\nYou can see here\nseveral ifs in our\nworkflow. And of course,\nthis is running in\nthe most powerful section\nof all your prompts,\nthe workflow. So this\nis great. You can\nsee our agent returning\nin that exact format.\nWe had AI docs\nreport right here, success\nor failure URL, markdown\npath, there it is.\nSo we have massive\ncontrol over this agent,\nright? We knew exactly\nwhat was gonna happen\nwhen we kicked off\nthis prompt, okay? And\nthis is the key\nfor transitioning to out\nloop agentic code and\nyou need to know\nwhat your prompts are\ngonna do. And the\nbest way to know\nis to be consistent\nand of course to\ntest and to prove\nout your agentic prompts,\nright? One more here,\nwe have the background\nprompt. Once again, I\nhope you're getting annoyed\nand kind of bored\nof this workflow, but\nthis is how you\nwrite great prompts at\nscale over and over\nand over for you,\nyour team and your\nagents. You stay consistent,\nokay? Metadata, title, purpose,\nright? We're using that\ndirect language run a\nClaude Code instance in\nthe background to perform\ntasks autonomously while you\ncontinue working. Okay, purpose\nclearly defined one or\ntwo sentences variables here\nyou can see we\nagent is going to\nkick off another primary\nagent in the background.\nAnd this agent is\ngoing to continue to\nreport to a report\nfile as it works\nin the background using\nwhatever model we specify.\nAll right. This is\nthe delegation prompt, right?\nThe delegate prompt. You\ncan have your agent\npass off work to\nother agents. Okay? Let's\nmove up the stack\nagain. Let's add more\npower to every one\nof our prompts. Let's\nmove up to level\nfive. Level five is\ninteresting. It's a concept\nwe discuss in tech\nand use quite a\nbit. This is the\nperfect prompt for running\nagentic workflows where there's\nsome dynamic elements that\nyou want to change\nwhile having the kind\nof top level infrastructure\nof your prompt, the\nhigher order prompt, you\nwant that to stay\nthe same. So what\nare examples of that?\nWe can, of course,\nopen up build. Okay.\nSo once again, we're\nback at the build\nprompt and, you know,\nclassic format, right? There's\nnothing new here. Metadata,\ntitle, purpose, variables, workflow,\nreport, input, work output.\nOkay. So what's going\non here, paths of\nthe plan. The big\nkey with the build\nprompt with these higher\norder prompts is that\nwe are passing in\nprompts into prompts. Okay.\nThis is a distinguishing\ncapability of your prompts.\nThis allows your prompts\nto scaffold top level\ninformation while you pass\nin work, right? Or\nplans in this case,\nright? We're passing in\nplans that we build\ndirectly in as a\nvariable. Okay. And so\nyou know what this\nlooks like. We don't\nneed to go over\nthis, but we could\ndo, you know, slash\nbuild and then pass\na path to a\nplan, right? Which is\ngoing to be in\nspecs, slash something, something,\nsomething.md. And this comes\nright out of your\nquick plan or your\nequivalent chore builder, feature\nbuilder, or your even\nmore specific specialized plans\nfor specific sections of\nyour codebase, your\nexperts, right? Very powerful.\nIn terms of where\nthis places on our\ntier list, these are\nharder to use and\nyou can embed all\nthis logic into the\nindividual prompts themselves, all\nright? We'll put this\nin B tier use\nand maybe this belongs\nin A, but I'm\ngonna put this in\nB tier for useful\nand ATF or difficulty.\nThis is very powerful\nif you know what\nyou're doing. The most\nobvious higher order prompt\nyou can create is\nthe one that just\nbuilds the work into\nyour codebase based\non the plan, all\nright? So this is\nthe higher order prompt,\nproviding a consistent structure\nso your lower level\nprompt can be changed\nand updated and operated\non, all right? Let's\nmove on to level\nsix. At level six,\nwe have the template\nMeta Prompt. Now, this\nis a prompt used\nto create another prompt\nin a specific format.\nLevels one through let's\nsay four will be\n80 or 90% of\nall of your prompts,\nright? And your code\nbases doing real engineering\nwork, getting things done\nfor you. When you\nget up to level\nfive, six and seven,\nyou really get into\nthat meta territory where\nyour prompts are building\nprompts and your prompts\nare improving your other\nprompts, all right? We'll\nget to that in\nlevel seven. The template\nmeta prompt is very\nimportant. As you saw\nin TAC, template meta\nprompts are an essential\nconcept for templating your\nengineering, okay? This is\na big, crucial idea.\nWe go at links\ndiscussing in TAC, okay?\nWhy is that? It's\nbecause in your templates,\nyou can teach your\nagents how to build\nlike you and your\nteam builds. You know,\nwe have team at\na prompt workflow. Let's\njust look at this.\nThere's a powerful prompt\nthat builds a prompt,\nbut you'll notice exact\nSame format with a\ncouple of changes here\nwith a couple pieces\nthat are important, all\nright? Metadata, title, purpose,\nvariables, where we're passing\nin that high level\nprompt, that becomes the\nSo basically look at\nthe context map, pull\nthat stuff in and\nthen operate, right? So\nvery powerful template meta\nprompt, to build out\nworkflows. Okay. So this\nis the, you know,\nlet's just be super\nclear about this. This\nis the most powerful\nprompt you can write.\nIt's the prompt that\ncreates your other prompts.\nOkay. Now again, this\nis going to be\nvery hard to use,\nright? Because not only\nare you writing a\nprompt, you're running a\nprompt that writes your\nprompts. But once you\nstart codifying these structures\nand once you start\ngetting your prompt formats\nvery consistent, I highly\nrecommend you build out\nthe prompt that generates\nyour prompts. This increases\nyour agenda engineering velocity\nby quite a bit\nright the prompt don't\nforget how we started\nthis the prompt is\nthe fundamental unit of\nengineering so engineers creating\nmore and better prompts\nat scale are the\nwinners here level six\nIt's at level six\nfor a reason, right?\nThis is the template\nmeta prompt. You have\nto really dig deep\nhere and think through\nwhat your agent is\ngoing to see and\ndo throughout this prompt.\nBut this is a\npowerful one. I'm giving\nthis to you here\nin this codebase\nto spark your imagination\nand to help you\nbuild out your next\nmeta prompt, okay? We\ncan look at one\nmore here. We have\nplan, byte view, and\nthis one's really interesting.\nWe're creating a plan\nfor building a net\nnew view three application\nwith TypeScript MVP from\nscratch. So this is\na rapid prototyping prompt.\nAnd of course, same\nold, we're not doing\nanything new or different\nhere. We come to\nthe prompt, we collapse\nand we understand. So\nyou can see this\nprompt has many of\nthe formats we've discussed,\nright? Including this code\nbase structure, right? Because\nwe want to let\nour agent know exactly\nwhat things are, where\nthey should go, right?\nWhat the structure looks\nlike. This prompt would\nabsolutely run without the\nsection, but it can\nhelp in small ways\nby speeding things up.\nYou can see we\nhave that template section,\nright? The plan format,\nwe're detailing exactly how\nwe want the plan\nto look like. And\nthen of course at\nthe bottom, we have\na report and we're\njust saying, give me\njust the path to\nthe plan you just\ncreated. A very powerful\nprompt. You can see\nhere, we're stacking up\nand swapping in a\nlot of our sections,\nright? So this is\nthe, template section. So\nagain, very powerful, very\nhard to use really\nthis belongs right underneath\nthe template meta prompt\nas it should write\nthis is hard to\ndo, but it gives\nyou a lot right\nthis will pay you\nback massive dividends for\nevery prompt you write\nthat you can have\nyour agent create for\nyou, all right? We\nstart delegating to other\nagents and we start\nlooping our agents back\nonto themselves, so to\nspeak, all right? That's\nthe template meta prompt,\nvery, very powerful prompt\nstructure. Let's move on\nto the final level\nand then let's talk\nabout system prompts versus\nuser prompts because we've\nbeen primarily looking at\nuser prompts. So at\nour final level, we\nhave the self-improving prompt.\nInside of Claude Command's\nexperts directory, we have\na new agent experts\npattern that we detail\nin our context engineering\nlesson. Check that out\nif you haven't. But\nthe idea here is\nquite simple. Inside this\nprompt here, we can\njust crack this open\nfor a second and\ncollapse. We have this\nexpertise section, right? And\nthis section is powerful.\nWe're not going to\ndive into exactly what\nthis does, but it\ngives this agent, it\ngives this expert specific\ndetails that we're going\nto have another agent\nor this agent itself\nupdate. So we went\nfrom meta prompts where\nwe have agents generating\nfresh brand new prompts,\nright? easier to create\nthan it is to\nupdate to level seven.\nWhere effectively we're having\nour agents update our\nagents. How? By having\nour prompts update our\nelement of your prompt\nto showcase what you\nwant, either the output\nor some result to\nlook like. This is\nvery useful and it\ndoesn't take that much\nskill to create. We're\ngonna put this in\nA tier right below\nvariables, right? Because this\ncan drastically increase your\nagent's performance. And then\nwe have relevant files.\nThis can be useful.\nThis is a lot\nlike code-based structure. When\nyou specify a set\nof files, it's going\nto speed things up\na little bit. It\ngives your agent a\nquick way to kind\nof reference and look\nat existing files. But\nthis isn't like a\nhuge game-breaking deal. You've\nused this, you've seen\nthis before. This is\ngonna be C tier\nusefulness, C tier skill\nrequirement, all right? So\nthis is our agentic\nprompt tier list. You're\ngoing to want to\npush to understand how\nto write template meta\nprompts because once you\nunlock this S tier\nskill and usefulness level,\nthese template meta prompts\nat level six here,\nyour agentic engineering velocity\nscales up very, very\nquickly, right? For you,\nyour team, and your\nagents, specifically because you've\ntemplated your agentic engineering,\nokay? This is This\nis the big, you\nknow, kind of the\npeak point of agentic\nprompt engineering. Once you\ncan create the prompt\nthat helps you create\nprompts, you start moving\nmuch faster than other\nengineers, right? Much, much\nfaster. You always want\nto come in, update,\ntweak things, but your\nability to have an\nagent, to have a\nspecialized workflow, to have\nspecialized sets of prompts\nthat allow you to\ngenerate new prompts very\nquickly will separate you\nfrom the rest of\nthe pack, all right?\nBecause the prompt is\nthe new fundamental unit\nof engineering. And with\nthe agentic prompt that\nscales much further and\nmuch farther. And you\nknow, to be clear\nhere, you should be\nwriting tons and tons\nof prompts. You want\nto be reusing, encoding,\nyou want to be\ntemplating your engineering into\nyour codebase in\nthis new outer layer\nthat we discuss at\nlength intact. That's what\nthis is all about.\nThese are the seven\nlevels. Let's talk about\nsystem prompts, versus user\nprompts. So the big\nidea here with a\nsystem prompt versus a\nuser prompt is the\nscope and level of\npersistence. Okay. It's important\nto just say this.\nYou likely already know\nthis, but you've likely\nwritten like most engineers,\nhundreds and thousands of\ntimes more user prompts,\nprobably even more than\nthat, but more user\nprompts than you have\nsystem prompts. You have\nto be a lot\nmore delicate when you're\nwriting your system prompts.\nSystem prompts are rules\nfor all conversations. The\nrules for for every\nuser prompt you write.\nAnd the scale of\nthe impact of this,\nwhen you're writing your\nagents, you only truly\nunderstand this and how\nimportant the system prompt\nis when you start\nbuilding your own agents.\nTo be clear, most\nengineers, as I've mentioned,\nyou will likely not\nget to the system\nprompt level. But if\nyou start building your\nown specialized agents to\nsolve problems extraordinarily well,\nyou will want to\ntap in to the\nsystem prompt. Okay. And\nin our background prompt,\nwe did this of\ncourse, because we are\nspinning up a brand\nnew Claude Code instance.\nThis is primary agent\ndelegation from a delegation\nprompt and we appended\nthe system prompt. Okay,\nso this is not\na system prompt overwrite,\nwhich we discuss in\nthe third agentic horizon\nextended lesson, where we\nfocus on the Claude\nCode SDK for building\nout agents, right? We\ncan do full system\nprompt overwrites, very dangerous,\nbut very powerful. You\ncan see here, we\nare appending key information\nthat we always want\nour agent to follow,\nokay? So here we're\nattaching some information, we're\nactually building out a\nworkflow into the system\nprompt. The system prompt\na specific system prompt.\nThis is what we'll\ndive into in our\nnext extended lesson, we're\ngoing to build specific\nagents where we're going\nto blow away the\nentire system prompt to\nsolve your domain specific\nproblem better than the\nout of the box\nClaude Code agent can\nor really any agent.\nThis is the big\ndifference, right? The system\nprompt is orders of\nmagnitude, probably, you know,\ndepending on how much\nyou use it, we'll\njust say one order\nof magnitude more important.\nReally, I think it's\nmore like two or\nthree. Why this matters\nis pretty simple, right?\nA bad system prompt\nis bad instructions for\nthe whole job, okay?\nThe whole job. Writing\nthis right is critically\nimportant. You know, we\ntalked about a couple\nkey sections for our\nuser prompts and to\nbe super clear every\nsection we broke down\nhere in our tier\nlist, we're grading this\nspecifically for user prompts,\nright? All of your\nClaude Code prompts, right?\nAnd all of your\nprompts that run in\nyour agent, these go\ninto your context window\nas a user prompt,\nokay? These are user\nprompts. Let's be super\nclear. Your system prompts,\nwe only have like\nfour system prompts in\nthis entire codebase.\nWe have it right\nhere, right? We're only\nmodifying the system prompt\nhere in this background\nagent delegation prompt. And\nthen we have a\ncouple of Claude Code\nwhich these themselves are\nsystem prompts. So this\nis an example of\na system prompt where\nwe're just saying, read\nthis and use this\nas your system prompt.\nBut typically you'll have\nsomething like this, right?\nSo our doc scraper\nagent that kicked up\nhas purpose. It has\na static output directory.\nRemember there are no\ndynamic variables coming in\nto your sub agents\nother than the prompt\nthat your primary agent\npasses in. This is\nthe system prompt for\nsub agent. And then\nwe have a workflow\nfor this, all right?\nSo the workflow step\nis useful. the report\nand response step can\nbe useful, but you\nalso don't wanna be\ntoo prescriptive with those\nsteps, okay? Usually, you\ndon't wanna be over\nprescriptive with your system\nprompt, okay? So for\nsub-agents, I think having\na workflow is good\nbecause you want your\nsub-agents to do a\nspecific thing, but for\nentire primary agent system\nprompts, you usually don't\nwanna prescribe a workflow,\nyou don't have variables,\noutside of static variables.\nAnd you don't really\nwant to touch reporting\nstructures, although you can\nspecify and steer the\noutput if you want.\nExpertise doesn't really make\nsense. Templates don't really\nmake sense. Metadata will\nall be passed in,\nright? Relevant files, code-based\nstructure. These are not\nthings you want to\nusually prescribe to your\nsystem prompt. All right,\nthe key sections for\nthe system prompt with\nthe exception of workflow.\nYou can have detailed\nabout your agents. It's\nnot just about you.\nIt's not just about\nyour team. You need\nto hit the trifecta,\nall right? The stakeholder\ntrifecta for the age\nof agents. There's a\nnew user, there's a\nnew profile, there's a\nnew type of consumer\nof the work that\nyou're doing. It's your\nagent. So we need\nto be thinking about\nthis trifecta as we're\nwriting great agentic prompts.\nConsistency is king when\nit comes to writing\ngreat agentic prompts. You\nknow, there are other\nsections that we didn't\nwork through. There are\nother ways to express\nthese sections, that's not\nwhat's important here, okay?\nThe key idea here\nis that you have\nswappable Lego blocks that\nare the sections of\nyour agentic prompts that\neach have distinct uses\nand capabilities that you\ncan use for repeat\nsuccess in your agentic\nengineering, okay? The prompt\nis the fundamental unit\nof engineering. Invest in\nyour prompts for the\ntrifecta to achieve asymmetric\nengineering in the age\nof agents, okay? Context\nengineering is very important,\nUse these seven levels\nof agentic prompt formats\nto guide your agentic\nengineering. Use the sections\nunderneath interchangeable and focus\non getting use out\nof your agents, right?\nStart at the lowest\nlevel, just throw it\ninto a level one\nad hoc high level\nprompt. And then when\nyou need to scale\nit into a workflow\nprompt, this is gonna\nbe where you get\nthe majority of your\nprompt output from the\nstep-by-step play of what\nyour agent to do.\nAfter that, you can\nscale up and stack\nup your capabilities leading\nyou all the way\nup to the powerful\ntemplate meta prompt, the\nprompt that builds the\nprompt, the agent that\nbuilds the agent. This\nis how you scale\nhard and fast in\nto the age of\nagents. And this is\nhow you become an\nagentic engineer. Great work\nhere. This codebase\nis going to be\navailable to you. That's\ngoing to be available\nin your loot box\nbelow. I'll see you\nin the next extended\nlesson.",
  "summary": "This lesson covers the seven levels of agentic prompt formats and introduces the stakeholder trifecta: you, your team, and your agents. The prompt is now the fundamental unit of engineering - one well-crafted prompt can generate hundreds of hours of productive work. The lesson presents prompt sections as composable Lego blocks: Title, High-Level Prompt, Workflow/Steps, Report/Output Format, Variables, Examples, Relevant Files, Codebase Structure, and Template Meta Prompts. These are ranked in a tier list by usefulness and skill required. Template Meta Prompts (S-tier) are the most powerful - prompts that generate other prompts. The goal is building libraries of reusable, battle-tested agentic prompts that scale engineering impact with compute.",
