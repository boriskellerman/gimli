  "transcript": "Welcome to lesson one\nof Tactical Agentic Coding.\nI have to say\nright away, I'm incredibly\nexcited to be here\nwith you. What we're\ngoing to accomplish here\nis nothing short of\nextraordinary. If you're here,\nyou've realized something critical.\nAI coding is not\nenough. Engineering is about\nmuch more than just\nwriting code. In your\nfirst lesson, we're going\nto set the stage\nand discuss the one\nidea you need to\ntransform from a phase\none AI coding engineer\ninto an entirely new\nrole of engineering. If\nyou understand the concepts\nin this lesson, you're\nsetting yourself up to\nmaximize the value of\nTAC, Tactical Agentic Coding.\nSo what is this\nnew role? In 2023,\nI bought the domain\nname you're looking at\nright now, agenticengineer.com, predicting\nthat a new role\nof software engineering would\nemerge, defined by the\nability to build systems\nthat can take actions\nas we can. It's\nbecome clear this new\nrole now exists. In\nthe generative AI age,\nAI coding was phase\none. Here we saw\nthe birth of VibeCoders\nand the complete commoditization\nof code. We learn\nthe principles of AI\ncoding and use the\nbig three context model\nprompt to build faster\nthan ever. Agentic coding\nmarks phase two. This\nis where real engineers\nstrike back. They uplevel\nonce again and turn\ntheir codebases into\nincreasingly self-operating machines. We\nhave one mission in\nTactical Agentic Coding. Transform\nyou into an engineer\nthey can't replace. You\nknow who they are.\nIt's your boss. It's\nthe company. It's the\nindustry. It's AI. No\nmatter how great your\njob is or how\nmany skills you have\nin the tech world,\nnothing is forever. You\nmust constantly evolve. How\nare we going to\naccomplish this? How can\nyou become an irreplaceable\nengineer? In a world\nwhere code is a\ncommodity, in a world\nwhere your grandma or\nyour little brother can\nbuild an app with\none prompt? The answer\nis simple. We do\nwhat we always do\nin technological revolutions. We\nmove up the stack\nonce again. We become\na commander of compute\nand you don't just\nprompt to generate code.\nThat's phase one engineering.\nAI coding is not\nenough. You know this.\nYou take this compute\nand you use it\nto build systems that\nbuild systems. Once you\nlearn how to do\nthis, you will become\na phase two Agentic\nEngineer. Engineering was never\nabout writing code. It's\nabout building systems of\nleverage that produce valuable\noutcomes for your users\nand your customers. Great.\nSo we understand the\nmission and the strategy\nof Tactical Agentic Coding,\nbecome an irreplaceable engineer.\nBut how does this\ncourse help you get\nthere? Throughout eight lessons,\nwe'll break down eight\ntactics of Agentic Coding.\nAs you progress through\neach lesson, you'll unlock\nvaluable prompts, links, commands,\nideas, and other useful\nassets in your loot\nbox below this video.\nTake a look now.\nYou'll have several ideas\nand loot items already\navailable. Every lesson contains\na codebase you\ncan optionally follow along\nwith. And most importantly,\nevery lesson contains one\ncritical tactic of Agentic\nCoding. The tactic is\nthe most important thing\nfor you to focus\nwhen you finish this\ncourse and when you\ndo your part and\nput these tactics to\nwork, you'll become an\nirreplaceable engineer. Only ambitious\ngoals are worth having.\nI built this course\nwith this goal so\nthat even if you\nor I fall short,\nyou'll still land on\nMars or the moon\nfar ahead of the\nrest. I want to\nbe absolutely clear. What\ndoes it mean to\nbe an irreplaceable engineer\nin phase two with\nagentic coding as your\nnew tool of engineering?\nWe'll get to the\nfirst tactic soon. We'll\nstart agentic coding, but\nWe really need to\nset expectations here and\nwe really need to\nbreak down what it\nmeans to win. If\nwe set the foundation\nright, everything else will\nfall into its place.\nIn every software revolution,\nthere's an opportunity for\nyou to become the\nfabled 10x engineer, not\nby spending 10x the\ntime or effort, but\nby achieving 10x the\nleverage this number is\narbitrary it's 2x it's\n10x it's 100x it\nall depends on the\nleverage points you can\nfind 80 of life\nis noise space boring\nrepetition and wasted time\nbut every once in\na while an opportunity\npresents itself to you\nthat can change everything\nif you focus somehow\nyou made it here\nto tactical agentic coding\nYou found a massive\nopportunity. Now it's time\nto give it your\nall. If you do\nthis right, it will\nchange everything. The irreplaceable\nengineer in phase two\nthat we're aiming to\nbecome is the engineer\nthat transforms their code\nbases into self-operating machines.\nThis course teaches you\nthe tactics of agentic\ncoding to maximize your\nleverage so much so\nthat your code base\nliterally runs itself. You'll\nlearn how to invest\nyour time in the\nright places and repeatedly\nextract value by using\nthe right compute across\nyour tools, products, and\ncodebases. This is\nambitious. I've poured over\na year into making\nthis insane goal achievable\nfor you here across\neight lessons. If you\ncan put in the\nwork to study each\ntactic. If you like\nthis plan, if you\nlike where this is\ngoing, let's dive in\nto the first tactic\nthat pulls your future\nabilities into the present.\nBrace yourself. The first\ntactic is dead simple,\nis mission critical, and\npotentially uncomfortable. Stop coding.\nLet me say that\none more time for\ncomplete clarity. Stop coding.\nThis is the not\nso controversial, controversial thing\nto say in the\ntech ecosystem, but you\nmight understand this already.\nMost engineers AI coding\nhave internalized this tactic\nat some level, but\nwe have to take\nit all the way.\nLet's end the debate\nright now. Your hands\nand your mind are\nno longer the best\ntool for the job\nof writing code full\nstop. Powerful language models\ncalled the Agentic Loops\nrunning on powerful supercomputers\nare now vastly superior\ncoders than you and\nI are. Don't be\nthe engineer that can't\nlet go of the\npast. So stop coding\nand use the best\ntool for the job.\nTrust me, I miss\ncoding too. I've spent\nover a decade working\nat startups, large companies,\ntyping code by hand,\nhoning my craft, mastering\nlanguages, understanding syntax, algorithms,\ndata structures, doing it\nall by hand. But\nremember, you're an engineer,\nnot a coder. The\ndifference is massive. Throughout\nTAC, Tactical Agentic Coding,\nwe're not going to\ntype a single line\nof code. I need\nyou on board with\nthis uncomfortable tactic. This\nis the first and\nmost foundational tactic. Imagine\neight tactics stacked up\non each other. We're\ngonna break through them\none by one. Some\nare required. Some will\naccelerate your capabilities. If\nyou're still typing code,\nyou have no chance\nof keeping up. I'm\ngonna say exactly what\nI need to say\nin this course to\ntransform your engineering. It's\ngoing to be sharp\nsometimes, and I'm gonna\nsay things you might\nnot wanna hear, but\nthis is why you're\nhere. It's up to\nyou to accept, trust,\nand bet on the\ntactics we'll break down\nlesson by lesson. Now,\nthis of course doesn't\nmean you don't generate\ncode. After all, code\nis one of the\nprimary assets that generates\nfeatures, that generates products.\nCode understanding is still\ncritically important. But we're\nnot coding anymore. To\nscale into this new\nphase two role, we\nneed to allocate our\nengineering cycles to planning,\nright now. If you're\nmissing any one of\nthese tools, pause the\nvideo and check your\nloop box for links\nto install your missing\ntool. Now let's go\nahead and move to\na fresh directory for\nTactical Agentic Coding code\nbases. We'll clone in\nthe lesson one code\nbase. Link for this\nis gonna be available\nto you in your\nloop box below. Change\ndirectories into this repository.\nAnd now let's open\nyour favorite IDE. I'll\nbe using VS Code\nthroughout these lessons. Code.\nLet's open the terminal\nwith command J and\ntype Claude. Throughout Tactical\nAgentic Coding, Claude Code\nwill be our primary\nAgentic Coding tool. We're\ngoing to be using\nmillions and millions of\ntokens. So make sure\nyou have the funds\nor the Claude plan\nto support it. We're\ngoing for maximum return\non investment in order\nto tap into these\ncapabilities We have to\npay to play. Now,\njust as ADER was\nfor the AI coding\nphase one era, Claude\nCode represents the best\nphase two Agentic Coding\ntool to teach execute\nand tap into the\nnext generation of engineering.\nAs we progress through\neach lesson, you'll understand\nexactly what I mean.\nSo your Claude Code UI\nmight look different. You\nmight be using newer\nmodels. That's all great.\nThat's fantastic. We know\nthat tools will change\nand models will improve.\nDon't let that distract\nyou from the value\nembedded in each lesson\nhere. Claude Code is our\nprimary agentic coding tool\nfor many reasons we'll\nexplore throughout the course.\nBut keep in mind,\nthese tactics are transferable.\nto the right Agentic\nCoding tools that have\nthe right capabilities. Don't\nget stuck on any\none tool. In this\ncodebase, you'll see\none file and two\ndirectories. Inside of .claude,\nwe have our permissions\nfor Claude Code. I\nhighly recommend you always\ncheck out the settings\nso you know what\nClaude Code has access\nto. We have a\nprogrammable directory we're gonna\ndiscuss in a moment.\nLet's go ahead and\nopen up the readme\nand let's run an\nAI coding prompt and\nthen an agentic coding\nprompt to really understand\nwhat's different between AI\ncoding and agentic coding.\nSo let's open up\nCloud Code here, copy\nthe contents from the\nAI coding prompt, paste\nit right in, fire\nit off. This first\nprompt represents what can\nbe done with AI\ncoding at a foundational\nlevel. You've seen this\na million times already.\nClaude Code here is\njust going to create\nthis file. We now\nhave this new main\nfile with the print\nthat we expect. This\nis nothing new. This\nis AI coding. We\ncan do this at\nscale. We can get\ntons of files generated\nfor us. We can\nhave our agents and\nour LLMs generate code\nfor us. This represents\nphase one. Let's talk\nabout phase two and\nwhat's different. If we\nscroll down here, you'll\nsee the Agentic Coding\nprompt. Let's go ahead,\ncopy this and do\nthe same thing. Just\nkick this off. You're\nlikely already familiar with\nthis log code, setting\nup a checklist, setting\nup a plan for\nwhat we're going to\ndo. And then it's\nexecuted all of these\nsteps one by one\nby one. This second\nprompt represents what can\nbe done with agentic\ncoding at a foundational\nlevel. You've likely already\nbeen running Agentic Coding\nprompts, which are prompts\nthat can call tools.\nBig whoop, who cares?\nLet's slow down here\nbecause the difference between\nthese two prompts is\nmonumental. It's absolutely massive.\nOkay, let's set up\nthe groundwork that we're\ngoing to walk, run,\nand then blast off\nfrom. Claude Code is\nnot just writing code.\nIt's calling tools. It's\ndoing engineering work. You\ncan see here, we\nchecked out a brand\nnew branch. You can\nsee we're on this\ndemo Agentic Coding branch\nnow. We wrote this\nnew main tack file.\nWe can open that\nup, main tack. We\nhave a print. hello\nagentic coding world. And\nwe have a print\ndescribing what AI agents\nare. We then ran\nour previous AI coding\nprompt, got the output,\ngoodbye AI coding. And\nthen we ran our\nmain tack files. You\ncan see the output\nthere, git add, git\ncommit, Claude Code, cleaned\nup the to-do list\nand reported what's been\ndone. This is Agentic\nCoding. With AI coding,\nyou've been interacting with\nthe big three, context,\nmodel, prompt. This is\na principle of AI\ncoding. It's always there\neven if you can't\nsee it. Agentic Coding\nis a superset of\nAI coding. Agentic Coding\nexpands on the big\nthree by adding one\nnew dimension. You already\nknow what this new\ndimension is. It's been\nhiding in plain sight\nand becoming more and\nmore capable over time.\nThe new element that\ntransforms the big three\nof AI coding to\nAgentic Coding is\nprompts that can reliably\nexecute long chains of\ntools. When you add\nscale and performance. So\nwhat's the difference here?\nWhy is this so\nimportant? Why am I\ndifferentiating between the AI\ncoding prompt and the\nAgentic Coding prompt? The\nbig difference here is\nthat tools have changed\nand models have improved.\nWe need to take\ninto account a new\nform factor of engineering.\nWe need to take\ninto account Claude Code.\nClaude Code is the\nfirst Agentic Coding tool\nto properly combine three\nessential elements, a powerful\nlanguage model that can\nreason when needed, the\nability to consistently call\nlong chains of tools\nand the right agent\narchitecture. This is a\ndifferentiating factor of cloud\ncode that will and\nis being copied by\nother tools. Why is\nthat? It's because this\ncapability unlocks the core\nfour and the core\nfour unlocks the Agentic\nCoding prompt. Now, these\nare just known as\nprompts. Okay, everyone knows\nthese as just plain\nold prompts now that\ncan call tools. People\ndon't think about this.\nPeople don't really invest\nthe time to understand\nwhat this means. But\ndon't turn your brain\noff in thinking you\nunderstand the scale in\nwhich the core four\nand the Agentic prompt\nchanges engineering work forever.\nWhen you take the\ncore four and wrap\nit in an Agentic\nCoding tool like Claude\nCode, you can create\nAs you'll see in\nthis course, long running\nend to end AI\ndeveloper workflows that run\nfor minutes to hours\nwith and without your\noversight. What we'll explore\nthroughout this course is\nthe scale of engineering\nwork that you can\naccomplish with the Agentic\nCoding prompt firing off\nin the right Agentic\nCoding tool over and\nover and over with\nthe right triggers, with\nthe right leverage at\nthe right time in\na highly performant, self-validating\nfashion. Reliable Agentic Coding\nat scale was not\npossible before Claude Code.\nEverything we do in\nTAC is built upon\nthis core idea you\ncan see right in\nthis readme with just\n35 lines. Okay. Everything\nis about this difference,\nright? It's about this\ncapability here, the Agentic\nCoding prompt. We can\nalso just shorten this\nto just be the\nAgentic prompt. A prompt\ncontains a sequence of\ntool calls. Again, these\nare just known as\nprompts, but it's important\nto distinguish these because\nwith the right context,\nmodel, prompt, and now\ntools, these prompts are\nnow more capable than\never before. Now we\nhave to make one\nmore important call out\nabout Claude Code. Not\nonly can it run\nmassive, and I mean\nmassive, Agentic Coding prompts,\nwhich we'll explore in\nupcoming lessons. Claude Code is\nalso a programmable Agentic\nCoding tool. What does\nthis mean? It means\nwe can run it\nfrom any programming language\nthat has terminal access.\nGo ahead, choose your\nfavorite scripting language out\nof these three, shell,\nTypeScript with Bunn, or\nPython with Astral UV,\nand fire off Claude Code\nfrom one of these\nscripts. I'm going to\ngo ahead and run\nPython with Astral UV.\nI'm just going to\ncopy this. I'm going\nto open up a\nbrand new terminal instance\nback into main. If\nwe open up programmable\nyou'll see these three\nscripts and you'll also\nhave the prompt that's\ngoing to run inside\nof every one of\nthese scripts that's going\nto call clog code\nin a programmable fashion\nyou can see here's\nthe python version here's\nthe shell version and\nhere's the bun typescript\nversion so before we\nkick this off let's\ngo ahead clear up\nthat branch and run\ngit branch we can\nsee that branch that\nwas generated by the\ninitial run i'm just\ngoing to get branch\ndelete this and then\ni'm going to run\nthe python version of\nthis I'm gonna go\nahead and kick this\noff and it's going\nto rerun that workflow.\nHere's the prompt it's\nrunning. And here is\nprogrammable.python. So you can\nsee this exactly what's\nrunning. If we open\nup.py, you can see\nexactly what this looks\nlike. This is a\nkey element, is a\nkey advantage of Claude\ncode that once again,\ndifferentiates it from all\nthe other agentic coding\ntools. This is super,\nsuper critical, right? We\nneed this capability of\nhaving a programmable agentic\ncoding tool. Why is\nthat? It's because we\nwanna be building systems\nthat build systems for\nus. And with this,\nyou can see these\nfiles are getting created,\nour branch just changed.\nWith this capability, with\nthe agentic coding tool\nthat we can program,\nwe can embed our\nown agents, our own\nworkflows, our own agentic\nprompts across the software\ndevelopment lifecycle. This is\nyou can see there's\nour output there. In\nour prompt, we requested\na full report of\nthe outputs, and that's\nexactly what we got\nhere. The fact that\nCloud Code runs in\nthe terminal means we\ncan run it across\nall developer environments, including\nfull agentic environments where\nwe're not even present.\nWe're gonna be talking\nabout agentic triggers in\nthis course, but in\naddition to that, Cloud\nCode can be embedded\ninside of your code\nbase firing off when\nit needs to doing\nthe right thing at\nthe right time. So\nthese files got created,\nall of this work\nran. Here's the prompt.\nYou have access to\nall of this. This\nsingle code base, this\nhyper simple code base\nsets up and frames\neverything we're going to\ndo in tactical agentic\ncoding. We're going to\ntake this idea of\nthe agentic prompt and\nwe're going to scale\nit to the max.\nGreat work here. This\nwas a dense lesson\none. But this essential\ntactic, stop coding, and\nthe key difference between\nAI coding and agentic\ncoding will ripple throughout\nevery lesson moving forward.\nAgentic coding is not\nabout us writing code.\nIt's about building systems\nthat build systems on\nour behalf. The contradicting\ntruth about what you'll\nlearn in tactical agentic\ncoding is this. To\nbecome an irreplaceable engineer,\nyou will replace yourself.\nYou won't see any\nvibe coders replicating what\nyou'll be able to\ndo when you finish\ntactical agentic coding. Evolution\nis hard. It's challenging.\nWe're going to push\nthrough hard concepts. On\nlesson one, I've already\nrequested that you stop\ncoding, right? We're using\nthe best tool for\nthe job. Evolution forces\nus to leave skills\nbehind to adapt new\nones and bet on\npotential futures. But in\nthe tech industry, this\nis where all the\nalpha lies. This is\nwhere your asymmetric engineering\nadvantage exists. It's in\nthe future. It's in\npushing what's possible forward.\nLet's start scaling the\ncore for the Identic\nPrompt and Cloud Code\ninto real engineering work\nacross worlds. the software\ndevelopment lifecycle. Next up,\nwe'll explore the most\nimportant leverage points of\nagentic coding so that\n10 minutes of your\nwork is equivalent to\n60 minutes or more\nof another engineer's work.\nGreat job here. I'll\nsee you in lesson\ntwo.",
  "summary": "This introductory lesson establishes the foundational mindset for Tactical Agentic Coding. The core message: stop coding by hand. Your hands and mind are no longer the best tools for writing code. Phase 1 of the generative AI age was AI coding (using prompts to generate code). Phase 2 is Agentic Engineering - building systems that build systems. The lesson introduces the first tactic: Stop Coding. Engineers are not coders; engineering is about building systems of leverage that produce valuable outcomes. The lesson demonstrates the difference between AI coding (generating code) and Agentic coding (agents that can call tools and perform engineering work). It introduces Claude Code as a programmable agentic coding tool that can be called from shell, Python, or TypeScript scripts.",
  "key_concepts": "1. STOP CODING: The foundational tactic. Your hands and mind are no longer the best tools for writing code. If you are still typing code, you have no chance of keeping up. Throughout the course, not a single line of code will be typed manually.\n\n2. PHASE 1 VS PHASE 2 OF GENERATIVE AI: Phase 1 was AI coding - using prompts to generate code (vibe coding, cursor, copilot). Phase 2 is Agentic Engineering - building systems that build systems, where agents can take actions autonomously.\n\n3. ENGINEER VS CODER: Engineering was never about writing code. It is about building systems of leverage that produce valuable outcomes for users and customers. The difference is massive.\n\n4. AI CODING VS AGENTIC CODING: AI coding generates code from prompts. Agentic coding uses agents that can call tools, execute plans, check out branches, run scripts, and perform real engineering work - not just write code.\n\n5. THE AGENTIC ENGINEER ROLE: A new role in software engineering defined by the ability to build systems that can take actions. The domain agenticengineer.com was registered in 2023 predicting this role would emerge.\n\n6. CLAUDE CODE AS A PRIMITIVE: Claude Code is not just for writing code - it calls tools and does engineering work. More importantly, it is programmable and can be called from any language with terminal access (shell, Python with UV, TypeScript with Bun).\n\n7. EIGHT TACTICS OF AGENTIC CODING: The course breaks down eight tactics across eight lessons. Each lesson unlocks prompts, commands, links, and assets in a loot box. Tactics stack on each other - some required, some accelerate capabilities.\n\n8. COURSE STRUCTURE: Each lesson contains a codebase to follow along with and one critical tactic of agentic coding. The TAC (Tactical Agentic Coding) approach transforms phase 1 AI coding engineers into phase 2 Agentic Engineers."
