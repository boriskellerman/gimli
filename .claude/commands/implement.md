# Implement Plan

## Purpose
Follow the instructions to implement the plan, then report the completed work.

## Instructions
1. Read the plan file provided as argument
2. Think hard about the plan and understand every step
3. Execute each step in order, top to bottom
4. Run all validation commands specified in the plan
5. Self-correct if any validation fails
6. Report the completed work

## Execution Rules
- Execute steps sequentially unless explicitly parallelizable
- Stop and fix issues before proceeding if a step fails
- Run validation commands after implementation
- If tests fail, fix the issue before continuing
- Commit only when explicitly requested

## Report
After completing the plan, summarize:
1. **Work Completed**: List all changes made
2. **Files Changed**: Output of `git diff --name-only`
3. **Validation Results**: Results of all validation commands
4. **Issues Encountered**: Any problems and how they were resolved
