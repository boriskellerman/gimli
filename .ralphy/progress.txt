# Task: Run `gimli onboard --install-daemon` on Linux server

## Date: 2026-01-30

## Summary
Successfully ran `gimli onboard --install-daemon` on Linux server. The command installed a systemd user service for the gimli gateway.

## Errors Encountered

### 1. Build Error: Missing `allowUnsafeExternalContent` type property
- **File:** `src/gateway/server-http.ts:141`
- **Error:** `Property 'allowUnsafeExternalContent' does not exist on type 'HookAgentPayload'`
- **Resolution:** Added `allowUnsafeExternalContent?: boolean` to `HookAgentPayload` type in `src/gateway/hooks.ts`

### 2. Missing Workspace Templates
- **Error:** `Missing workspace template: IDENTITY.md (/tmp/tmp.1h0LJfCPN0/agent-1/docs/reference/templates/IDENTITY.md). Ensure docs/reference/templates are packaged.`
- **Root Cause:** The repository had `IDENTITY.dev.md` and `USER.dev.md` but was missing the non-dev versions (`IDENTITY.md` and `USER.md`) that the onboard command expects
- **Resolution:** Created the missing template files:
  - `docs/reference/templates/IDENTITY.md`
  - `docs/reference/templates/USER.md`

### 3. Doctor Warning (non-blocking)
- **Warning:** `State dir migration skipped: target already exists (/home/gimli/.gimli). Remove or merge manually.`
- **Nature:** Non-blocking warning about existing state directory

## Result

After fixes, the command succeeded:
- Systemd service installed at: `/home/gimli/.config/systemd/user/gimli-gateway.service`
- Service status: `active (running)`
- Gateway running on port 18789

## Files Modified
- `src/gateway/hooks.ts` - Added missing type property
- `docs/reference/templates/IDENTITY.md` - Created new template file
- `docs/reference/templates/USER.md` - Created new template file

# Task: Verify Node ≥22 is installed; if not, install it

## Status: COMPLETED

## Summary
Verified that Node.js v22.22.0 is installed, which meets the ≥22 requirement.

## Details
- Node.js version: v22.22.0
- npm version: 10.9.4
- Installation method: NVM (Node Version Manager)
- Binary location: /home/gimli/.nvm/versions/node/v22.22.0/bin/node

## Verification Steps Performed
1. Checked Node.js version with `node --version` - returned v22.22.0
2. Programmatically verified major version >= 22 - confirmed true
3. Verified npm is working - version 10.9.4
4. Confirmed binary locations via `which node` and `which npm`

## Result
No installation was needed - the system already has Node.js 22+ installed and configured correctly.
